# Oh, what's there? #

A knockout.js map project in the making. Proof of concept demo.

___

### Description: ###
~~A map of Berlin that shows a number of art spaces (museums, galleries, project spaces). The spaces are searchable, and an info window gets displayed when clicking on a space's listing in the search results or when clicking the marker on the map.~~

Due to a lack of relevant api in the cultural sector in Berlin, and with Twitter and Instagram being outside of the scope of this project, I have changed it to a map of lakes in Berlin, making use of Berlin city's own api endpoints, together with information retrieved via the Wikipedia api.

### TODO: ###

* Add more locations (currently 2 for testing)
* Styling
* Generate more info
* Retrieve streetview image
* Retrieve Wikipedia info
* other API?
